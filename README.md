# Laravel 11 Project with Reverb Setup

This project is a Laravel 11-based web application that requires **Reverb** for certain functionality. Follow the steps below to set up the project after cloning it from GitHub.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, make sure you have the following tools installed:

- [PHP 8.1+](https://www.php.net/downloads.php) (Laravel 11 requires at least PHP 8.1)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Steps to Set Up the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-laravel-project.git
cd your-laravel-project
```

### 2. Set Up the Database

- Create a new database in your MySQL server (e.g., `your_project_db`).
- Configure your database settings in the `.env` file:

```env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=your_project_db
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```
### 3. Install PHP Dependencies

Install the PHP dependencies using Composer:

```bash
composer update
```

Laravel 11 comes with an updated set of dependencies, so Composer will take care of installing the necessary packages.

### 4. Set Up Reverb

Reverb is a package that integrates with your Laravel project for enhanced functionality. Follow these steps to set up Reverb.

```bash
npm run dev  # For development build
