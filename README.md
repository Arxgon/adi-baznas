# Laravel 11 Project with Reverb Setup

This project is a Laravel 11-based web application that requires **Reverb** for certain functionality. Follow the steps below to set up the project after cloning it from GitHub.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, make sure you have the following tools installed:

- [PHP 8.1+](https://www.php.net/downloads.php) (Laravel 11 requires at least PHP 8.1)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Steps to Set Up the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-laravel-project.git
cd your-laravel-project
```

### 2. Install PHP Dependencies

Install the PHP dependencies using Composer:

```bash
composer install
```

Laravel 11 comes with an updated set of dependencies, so Composer will take care of installing the necessary packages.

### 3. Set Up Environment File

Copy the `.env.example` file to create your own `.env` file. This file contains the environment-specific configuration for your Laravel application:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 4. Generate Application Key

Run the following command to generate a new application key, which will be used for encryption and session management:

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

### 5. Set Up the Database

- Create a new database in your MySQL server (e.g., `your_project_db`).
- Configure your database settings in the `.env` file:

```env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=your_project_db
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```

- Run the migrations to create the necessary tables in your database:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### 6. Install Node.js Dependencies (for Frontend Assets)

If your project uses frontend assets managed by npm or yarn, install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or if you use yarn:
# yarn install
```

### 7. Set Up Reverb

Reverb is a package that integrates with your Laravel project for enhanced functionality. Follow these steps to set up Reverb.


### 8. Run the Development Server

You can now serve the application locally using the Laravel development server:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser to see the application running.

### 9. Compile Frontend Assets

If your project includes frontend assets (JavaScript, CSS), compile them using:

```bash
npm run dev  # For development build
# or
npm run prod # For production build
```

### 10. Additional Configuration

If your project requires any additional setup (e.g., configuring queues, caches, etc.), make sure to follow the relevant documentation for those services.

## Testing

To run the tests, you can use:

```bash
php artisan test
```

If you're using PHPUnit for testing, you can also run:

```bash
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```
